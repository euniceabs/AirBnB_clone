Project README
Introduction
In this README, we'll explore the concept of "web static" and provide an overview of our project, which involves using HTML and CSS for the frontend design of an Airbnb Clone.

What is Web Static?
"Web static" typically refers to "static web content" or "static web pages." Static web content consists of elements on a website that do not change unless manually updated by a developer or administrator. This content remains constant and does not depend on user interactions or data retrieved from a database.

Project Overview
In this project, we utilized HTML and CSS as our frontend tools to design an Airbnb Clone. Here's a brief overview of the project.

Project Goals
Clone Design: the primary goal was to recreate the design and user interface of the Airbnb website.
Frontend Development: this project focused on using HTML and CSS to build the static frontend components.
Static Content: The project's content is static, meaning it does not change dynamically based on user interactions.
Technologies Used
HTML: used HTML to structure the content of the web pages.
CSS: CSS was used to style and format the web pages, ensuring they resemble the Airbnb website's design.
Project Structure
This project is organized into the following components:

HTML Files: These files contain the structured content of our web pages.
CSS Files: Stylesheets are used to define the layout and presentation of our web pages.
Images: Static images, including logos and other graphics used in the project.
